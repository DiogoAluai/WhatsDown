### Whats Down
Internet down? WhatsApp won't help... now WhatsDown on the other hand will work fine!
Whats Down is a Lan messager, using mdns for service discovery and rudementary encryption.
The idea came up when work colleagues sat in a plane far from each other: 
"Wouldn't it be possible to open a hotspot and communicate without internet?"

#### Testing in real world scenario
- 2 phones in same network: works
- 2 phones connected to same hotspot: works
- 2 phones connected to same hotspot during a flight: to be tested

#### Activities
In the home screen other devices running WhatsDown will appear. 
User will be redirected to username picker activity during first launch, and username will then persist to database.
To open a conversation simply click on a user entry.
